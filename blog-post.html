          If you’re only in the Eternal City for a short amount of time, doing Rome in a day is possible. Follow our tips about how to plan out an action-packed day in Rome that includes the Vatican, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Colosseum, Roman Forum and more. Read on to find three pre-planned Rome itineraries to take the guesswork out of your trip to Rome:
        </p>
        <blockquote>Rome is one of the most iconic and most traveled cities in Europe, with a long history to match. With a mixture of cultures from around the world, Rome has it all. Wander the cobblestone street with gelato in hand, spend some time people watching from the Spanish Steps and take in all of the stunning architecture the city has to offer. Rome is also a foodie's heaven, from the world-class cuisine, to casual trattorias, to takeaway pizzas.</blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Colosseum Arena Floor Tour:</em> Stand where gladiators and wild animals once fought. Your guide will go into detail about the highly competitive and gruesome games that were fought right where you are standing, on the newly reconstructed Colosseum Arena Floor. Then, look up to the stands and imagine what it must’ve felt like here when it was filled with up to 60,000 screaming spectators. Before moving onto the Roman Forum, see the first and second tiers.
